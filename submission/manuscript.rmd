title: "Continuous risk-based predictive approaches to treatment effect heterogeneity: A simulation study"
abstract: |
  **Objective:** Compare risk-based methods for individualizing treatment 
  effects with simulations in the RCT setting. **Study Design and Setting:** We
  predicted absolute benefit based on an available prognostic index (PI) using:
  a model with the PI and a constant relative treatment effect; a model 
  including an interaction of treatment with the PI; 4 quarters of the PI; 
  nonlinear transformations of the PI (restricted cubic splines with 3, 4 and 5
  knots); an adaptive model selection method using Akaikeâ€™s Information 
  Criterion. Starting from a base case scenario (sample size 4,250, constant 
  odds ratio 0.8, AUC of the PI 0.75), we considered diverse assumptions by
  introducing linear and quadratic interactions of the PI with treatment and 
  varying sample size and discriminative ability of the PI. We evaluated
  performance using root mean squared error, discrimination and calibration for 
  benefit. **Results:** Models including a linear interaction of the PI with
  treatment had adequate performance that was robust under most simulation 
  scenarios. Restricted cubic splines required larger sample sizes and higher 
  AUC of the PI to achieve adequate performance. The adaptive approach performed 
  equivalently to the best-performing method in each scenario. **Conclusion:** 
  Usually, models with just a linear interaction of the PI with treatment
  adequately predict absolute benefit.

# Introduction

Within the setting of patient-centered outcomes research, predictive approaches
for assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) aim at the development of
models predicting either individualized effects or which of two (or more)
treatments is better for an individual [@Varadhan2013]. In prior work, we
divided such methods in three broader categories based on the reference class
used for defining patient similarity when making individualized predictions or
recommendations [@Rekkas2020]. Risk-modeling approaches use prediction of
baseline risk as the reference; treatment effect modeling approaches also model
treatment-covariate interactions, in addition to risk factors; optimal treatment
regime approaches focus on developing treatment assignment rules and therefore
rely heavily on modeling treatment effect modifiers.

Risk-modeling approaches to predictive HTE analyses provide a viable option in
the absence of well-established treatment effect modifiers [@Kent2019;
@PathEnE]. In simulations, modeling of effect modifiers in the form of
treatment-covariate interactions often led to miscalibrated predictions of
benefit, while risk-based methods proved quite robust [@vanKlaveren2019]. Most
often, risk-modeling approaches are carried out in two steps: first a risk
prediction model is developed externally or internally on the entire RCT
population, "blinded" to treatment; then the RCT population is stratified using
this prediction model to evaluate risk-based treatment effect variation
[@Kent2010]. However, even though estimates at the risk subgroup level are
accurate, this does not apply on the individual level, especially for patients
with predicted risk at the boundaries of the risk intervals. Therefore, the
risk-stratified approach should be used for exploring and presenting an overview
of HTE, while inferences on the individual level should be made with caution.

We aimed to provide an overview of methods that can be used to move from a
risk-stratified approach to a continuous one using common smoothing techniques.
These methods extend the risk-based framework of predictive HTE analyses to
allow predictions on the individual level, within the RCT setting. We carried
out a simulation study to compare the performance of these methods under
different settings of increasing non-linearity of treatment effects. Finally, we
carried out an application on real data as a demonstration of the considered
techniques.

# Methods

## Simulation scenarios

In the simulated datasets based treatment was allocated at random using a 50:50
split. For each patient we simulated $8$ baseline covariates, where
$x_1,\dots,x_4\sim N(0, 1)$ and $x_5,\dots,x_8\sim B(1, 0.2)$. Outcomes
for patients in the control arm were generated from a logistic regression model
including all baseline covariates. Coefficient values were such, so that the
prediction model had an AUC of $0.75$ and an event rate of $20\%$ in the control
arm was achieved. Under the base case scenario, outcomes in the treatment arm
were created using the same logistic regression model, including a constant
treatment odds ratio (OR) of $0.8$. The generated samples of the base case
scenario had sample size of 4,250 ($85%$ power for the detection of an
unadjusted OR of $0.8$).

We evaluated the effect of sample size considering additional scenarios with
sample sizes of `r 1064` and `r 17000`. We also evaluated the effect of prediction
performance, adjusting the baseline covariate coefficients, so that AUC values
of $0.65$ and $0.80$ were achieved when validating in a simulated dataset of
500,000 patients.

We simulated binary outcomes in the control arm using true probabilities 
$P(y=1|X) = \text{expit}(PI)$, where 
$\text{expit}(x)= \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}$. 
In the treatment arm outcomes where generated with probabilities
$\text{expit}(lp_1)$ with
$$ lp_1 = \gamma_2(PI-c)^2 + \gamma_1(PI-c) + \gamma_0,$$
where the coefficients $\gamma_0, \gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ along with the
centering constant $c$ were set for each simulation scenario. In this way we
were able to assess a wide variety of scenarios, ranging from true constant
relative treatment effects to moderate and strong linear and quadratic
deviations. We also considered scenarios with treatment-covariate interactions.
These scenarios include 4 weak interactions
($\text{OR}_{t_x=1} / \text{OR}_{t_x=0}=0.82$), 
4 strong interactions 
($\text{OR}_{t_x=1} / \text{OR}_{t_x=0}=0.61$), 
and 2 weak and 2 strong interactions. Combining all these different settings
resulted in a simulation study of $66$ scenarios. The exact settings for each
scenario are available in the supplementary material.

## Individualized risk-based benefit predictions

All methods assume that a risk prediction model is available and can be used to
assign individualized risk predictions. For the simulations we developed the
prediction models internally and blinded to treatment using logistic regression
including main effects for all baseline covariates and treatment. Risk
predictions on individuals were made setting treatment to $0$.

The *stratified HTE method* has been suggested as an alternative to
traditional subgroup analyses. Patients are stratified into equally-sized risk
strata---in this case based on risk quartiles. Absolute effects are estimated
using the differences in event rates between treatments within risk quarters. We
considered this approach as a reference, expecting it to perform worse than the
other candidates, as its objective is not individualized benefit prediction.

Another approach would be to assume *constant relative treatment effect* (OR) is
constant. In that case, absolute benefit is estimated from
$\hat{\tau}(\bm{x}) = \text{expit}(PI +\log(\text{OR}))$,
where $\text{expit}(x)=\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$
and *lp* is the linear predictor of the prediction model.

A different approach fits a logistic regression using treatment, the prognostic
index and their interaction. In this case absolute benefit is estimated from
$\text{expit}(\beta_0+\beta_{PI}PI) - \text{expit}(\beta_0+\beta_{t_x}+(\beta_{PI}+\beta_*)PI)$.
We will refer to this method as the *linear interaction* approach.

Finally, we used *restricted cubic splines* (RCS) to relax the linearity assumption on
the effect of the linear predictor [@Harrell1988]. We compared the results
for 3, 4 and 5 knots when fitting the splines to introduce increasing
flexibility to the methods considered.

## Evaluation metrics

For evaluating the prediction error of the considered methods we used root mean
squared error (RMSE), since both the true and the predicted benefits are known,
given that this is a simulation study. More specifically, we calculated RMSE
from
$$\text{RMSE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\big(\tau(\bm{x}_i) - \hat{\tau}(\bm{x}_i)\big)^2$$

We also compared the discriminative ability of the methods under study. We
assessed discrimination using the c-for-benefit statistic described in
[@vanKlaveren2018]. Patients in each treatment arm are ranked based on their
predicted benefit and then are matched 1:1, dropping patients in the larger
treatment arm without a pair. We define *observed* pair-specific treatment
benefit as the difference of observed outcomes between the untreated and the
treated patient of each pair. Pair-specific *predicted* benefit is defined as
the average of predicted benefits within each pair. Then, c-for-benefit is
defined as the probability that from two randomly chosen matched patient pairs
with unequal observed benefit, the pair with greater observed benefit also has a
higher predicted benefit.

We evaluated calibration in a similar manner, using the integrated calibration
index (ICI) for benefit [@Austin2019]. After creating pairs based on predicted
benefit, observed benefits are regressed on the predicted benefits using a
locally weighted scatterplot smoother (loess). The ICI is the average absolute
difference between predicted and smooth observed benefit. Values closer to $0$
represent better calibration.


# Results

## Simulations


The model including a constant relative treatment effect had the lowest median
RMSE in scenarios with a true constant relative treatment effect (OR = 0.8, N =
`r 4250` and AUC = 0.75) or moderate relative deviations were considered (Figure
\ref{fig:rmsebase}; Panel A). However, when we considered strong linear and
quadratic deviations from a constant relative treatment effect the linear
interaction model performed best (Figure \ref{fig:rmsebase}; Panels B and C).
Only in the case of strong quadratic deviations models including RCS (3 knots)
performed equally well to the linear interaction method. Increasing the number
of knots in RCS resulted in higher error rates across all scenarios. The
adaptive approach performed very similarly to the best performing model in each
scenario.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/rmse_base.png"))
```

When we increased the sample size (N = `r 17000`), the model including a
constant relative treatment effect had the lowest RMSE under the assumption of
true constant relative treatment effects (Figure \ref{fig:rmsesamplesize};
Panel A). Contrary to previous results with smaller sample sizes, when
introducing moderate and strong linear deviations the linear interaction model
performed best, outperforming the constant treatment effect model (Figure
\ref{fig:rmsesamplesize}; Panels B and C). However, the linear interaction
model was outperformed by the more flexible RCS models (3 knots) in the case of
strong quadratic deviations. Again, the increased flexibility of RCS smoothing
with higher number of knots resulted in overfitting and worse performance
(Figure \ref{fig:rmsesamplesize}; Panel D).

```{r rmsesamplesize, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RMSE of the considered methods across 500 replications calculated in a simulated sample of size 500,000. \\textit{Panel A} presents the results under the base case scenario of true constant relative treatment effect, with a true prediction AUC of 0.75 and sample size of 17,000; \\textit{Panel B} presents the results under moderate linear deviations from constant treatment effects; \\textit{Panel C} presents the results for strong linear deviations from constant relative treatment effects; \\textit{Panel D} presents the results for strong quadratic deviations constant relative treatment effects.", fig.show="hold", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/rmse_sample_size.png"))
```

When we increased the true prediction AUC to 0.85, models including RCS
smoothing had the lowest RMSE in the presence of strong quadratic deviations
from the base case of true constant relative treatment effects (Figure
\ref{fig:rmseauc}; Panel D). However, with milder deviations, the linear
interaction model had the lowest RMSE with the RCS smoothing methods (3 knots)
being a close second (Figure \ref{fig:rmseauc}; Panels B and C). Increasing the
number of knots of RCS smoothing resulted in increased RMSE, which was less
pronounced in the case of strong quadratic deviations.

```{r rmseauc, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RMSE of the considered methods across 500 replications calculated in a simulated sample of size 500,000. \\textit{Panel A} presents the results under the base case scenario of true constant relative treatment effect, with a true prediction AUC of 0.85 and sample size of 4,250; \\textit{Panel B} presents the results under moderate linear deviations from constant treatment effects, while holding true prediction AUC and sample size constant; \\textit{Panel C} presents the results for strong linear deviations from constant relative treatment effects; \\textit{Panel D} presents the results for strong quadratic deviations from constant relative treatment effects.", fig.show="hold", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/rmse_auc.png"))
```

The constant effects model, the linear interaction model and models with RCS
smoothing (3 knots) had the highest median c-for-benefit in the base case
scenario and the scenarios where linear and quadratic deviations were
considered. The constant treatment effect model and the linear interaction model
tended to present much lower variability compared to all other approaches
(Figure \ref{fig:discrimination}). We also observed an increasing trend of
discrimination for benefit variability and decreasing median values with
increasing number of restricted cubic spline knots in all scenarios.


```{r discrimination, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Discrimination for benefit of the considered methods across 500 replications calculated in a simulated sample of size 500,000. \\textit{Panel A} presents the results under the base case scenario of true constant relative treatment effect, with a true prediction AUC of 0.75 and sample size of 4250; \\textit{Panel B} presents the results under moderate linear deviations from constant treatment effects; \\textit{Panel C} presents the results for strong linear deviations from constant relative treatment effects; \\textit{Panel D} presents the results for strong quadratic deviations from constant relative treatment effects.", fig.show="hold", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/discrimination_base.png"))
```

When focusing on calibration, the linear interaction model had the lowest median
ICI for benefit in the majority of scenarios except for the scenarios where no
or moderate linear deviations from the base case were considered. In that case
constant treatment effect models demonstrated the best performance, very
comparable to the linear interaction model's performance, nonetheless (Figure
\ref{fig:calibration}). However, under strong linear or
quadratic deviations, the constant treatment effect model was very poorly
calibrated (Figure \ref{fig:calibration}; Panels C and D).

## Case study
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

gusto <- gusto %>%
  tibble() %>%
  filter(!is.na(tpa))

treatmentArms <- gusto %>%
  group_by(tpa) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

We demonstrate the different methods for individualizing treatment benefits
using data from `r nrow(gusto)` patients with an acute myocardial infarction
(MI) included in the GUSTO-I trial.
`r treatmentArms %>% filter(tpa == 1) %>% select(n)` patients were randomized to
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment and
`r treatmentArms %>% filter(tpa == 0) %>% select(n)` were randomized to
streptokinase. The outcome of interest was 30-day mortality, recorded for all
patients.

In line with previous analyses [@Califf1997; @Steyerberg2000], we fitted a logistic regression
model with 6 baseline covariates, i.e. age, Killip class, systolic blood
pressure, heart rate, an indicator of previous MI, and the location of MI, to
predict 30-day mortality risk. A constant effect of treatment was included in
the model. When deriving risk predictions for individuals we set the treatment
indicator to 0. More information on model development can be found in the
supplement.

We used the risk linear predictor to fit the the proposed methods under study
for individualizing absolute benefit predictions. All methods had quite
comparable results, in the sense that we predicted increasing benefits for
patients with higher baseline risk predictions. In terms of c-for-benefit 
(validated internally) all models had quite comparable performance ranging from
0.519 (RCS smoothing with 3 knots) to 0.542 (RCS smoothing with 4 knots).
Similar conclusions could be drawn in terms of ICI-for-benefit which ranged
from 0.0039 (linear interaction approach) to 0.0053 (RCS smoothing with 4
knots).

The adaptive approach picked the
model with RCS smoothing with 4 knots, which had quite comparable performance to
the smooth fit with 5 knots. However, for lower baseline risk these 2 models
predicted implausible benefits and maybe should be avoided when applying such
models in practice. The linear interaction model and the model with RCS
smoothing (3 knots) made very similar predictions and also followed quite
closely the evolution of the stratified estimates. In this case, we observed
that even using a simple model with a constant relative treatment effect can
result in very similar benefit predictions as other more complex approaches.

# Discussion

The linear interaction model proved to be flexible enough to adequately predict
benefit under a wide range of scenarios. It had lower error rates and usually
the highest c-for-benefit with the lower variability across simulation
replications. Its benefit predictions were also well-calibrated across the
majority of the simulation settings. Models with RCS smoothing with 3 knots
performed very similarly, only outperforming the linear interaction model in the
presence of strong quadratic deviations from the base case scenario of constant
relative treatment effects. These simpler methods proved to have quite robust
performance across all scenarios, which was not the case for more flexible
approaches.

Methods with RCS smoothing with 4 or 5 knots proved to be data-hungry and this
often led to overfitting with smaller sample sizes. This resulted in higher
RMSE, increased variability of discrimination for benefit and worse-calibrated
benefit predictions across simulation replications. Even with larger sample
sizes and strong quadratic deviations from the base case scenario of constant
relative treatment effects, these more flexible RCS smoothing methods did not
outperform simpler RCS smoothing with 3 knots. More flexible approaches usually
do not come with any added value, unless we expect extreme heterogeneity in
treatment effects.

The constant treatment effect model, despite having adequate performance even in
the presence of weak treatment effect heterogeneity on the relative scale, it
quickly broke down with stronger deviations from the base case scenario of
constant effects. In these cases, the stratified approach generally had lower
error rates compared to the constant treatment effect model. In concept, the
stratified approach lies between the constant effects model and smoother
approaches, only assuming constant treatment effects within strata of predicted
risk and, therefore, is more sensitive to treatment effect heterogeneity.
However, these stepwise benefit estimates can only be used as a demonstration of
treatment effect heterogeneity, identifying patient subgroups where treatment
benefits are expected to be higher or lower, and should not be used to make
individualized absolute benefit predictions.

Increasing the true prediction AUC by increasing the predictor coefficients of
the true risk model reduced RMSE for all methods, similar to increasing the
sample size. Higher AUC translates in higher variability of predicted risks,
which, in turn, allows the considered methods to better follow the evolution of
treatment benefit. Higher prediction AUC also led to higher absolute values of
c-for-benefit. Even though, model performance appears to be very important for
the performance of these methods, prediction model development was outside the
scope of this work and has already been studied quite extensively
[@vanKlaveren2019; @Burke2014; @Abadie2018].

Risk-based approaches to predictive HTE assume that benefit is a function of
baseline risk. A limitation of our study is that this was assumed to be the case
in the majority of the simulation scenarios. Even though our main conclusions
did not change when simulating true treatment-covariate interactions (results in
supplement), RMSE had higher values. The linear interaction model under these
scenarios again had the best overall performance under different sizes of the
interaction effects. This can be explained by the fact that linear interactions
with treatment were simulated, thus favoring the linear interaction model. In
studies evaluating prediction model development, the underlying outcome
generation process sometimes proved to affect performance of certain methods
[@Austin2021]. This might be the case here as well and should be explored in
more extensive future simulation studies.

Recent years have seen an increased interest in predictive HTE approaches
focusing on individualized benefit predictions. In our simulations we only
focused on risk-based methods, using baseline risk as a reference in a two-stage
approach to individualizing benefit predictions. However, there is a plethora of
different methods, ranging from treatment effect modeling to tree-based
approaches available in more recent literature [@Athey2019; @Lu2018;
@Wager2018]. Simulations are also needed to assess relative performance and
define the settings where these break down or outperform each other.

In conclusion, when comparing different risk-based approaches to individualizing
benefit predictions simpler models including a linear interaction with the
prognostic index or RCS smoothing with 3 knots had adequate performance under a
wide range scenarios. An adaptive approach selecting among the considered
methods with optimal AIC had satisfactory performance.

## Summary
Risk-based HTE analyses typically result in risk stratum specific estimates of treatment effects. Different approaches to individualize treatment effects have been proposed, but it is unclear which approach performs best under different circumstances. We aim  to compare different approaches to  estimating individualized treatment effects.
